        """Create an Index object for organism, requiring that a valid annotation have
        both an ENSEMBL id and at least one additional id provided by an
        additional_id_field (if provided)

        :param organism: name of the organism. Must be lower-case genus_species. For
          example, human=homo_sapiens, mouse=mus_musculus, etc.
        :param additional_id_types: (default: None) Names of additional ID types whose
          presence declares the associated ENSEMBL gene id a valid identifier. If multiple
          such fields are passed, a gene can be defined in any of the provided fields, and
          it will be declared valid. If no fields are passed, no ID filtering will be
          performed, and all genes with ENSEMBL ids will be considered valid.

          The effect of these fields is to limit the ENSEMBL genes to a subset of genes
          which are also defined by other consortia. The rationale for requiring multiple
          definitions is that ENSEMBL has very relaxed standards, with many of its genes
          being defined based on predicted locations without any biological evidence, or,
          more importantly, any associated biological information. These such genes are
          often uninformative as a result, and are better excluded from the index.

          example fields for human are ['hgnc_symbol', 'entrezgene'], example fields for
          mouse are ['mgi_symbol', 'entrezgene']

          to find out the specific spelling and case of different id fields you may want
          to use, you will need to generate sample XML queries from ENSEMBL BioMART.
          This README describes how to accomplish this:
